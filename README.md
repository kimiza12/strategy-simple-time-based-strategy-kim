**Description**: Simple, systematic "clock-only" strategy: act purely on time. Before 10:00 AM ET, enter long; after 10:00 AM ET, exit or flip. Rationale: probe opening-drive liquidity/momentum pre-10:00 and reduce midday noise by flattening after. Serves as a clean control before adding signals.

Objective:
isolate time-of-day execution effects.

Hypothesis:
- pre-10:00 captures opening drive/liquidity;
- post-10:00 emphasizes risk control/mean reversion.

Rules:
- single trade around a cutoff; DAY market orders; paper by default via CPZ AI gateway (no direct broker keys).

Requirements:
- CPZ_AI_API_KEY, CPZ_AI_SECRET_KEY, CPZ_STRATEGY_ID. Defaults broker "alpaca".

**Strategy Type**: Execution | **Implementation Date**: 10/23/2025 | **Status**: Development

## Overview

This repository contains a execution trading strategy implementation based on quantitative analysis and systematic market research. The strategy is designed to identify and exploit market inefficiencies while maintaining robust risk management protocols.

### Key Features

- Quantitative signal generation using mathematical models
- Risk-adjusted portfolio construction with dynamic position sizing
- Real-time execution framework with transaction cost optimization
- Comprehensive performance analytics and reporting
- Multi-layered risk controls and position limits
- Extensive backtesting with statistical validation

### Target Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Sharpe Ratio | > 1.5 |
| Maximum Drawdown | < 15% |
| Volatility Target | 12-18% annualized |
| Rebalancing | Daily/Weekly |
| Minimum Capital | $100,000+ |

---


## Research Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis (H₁)**: The execution trading approach will generate risk-adjusted returns superior to passive market exposure.

---


## Theoretical Framework

### Market Efficiency & Behavioral Finance Foundation
The strategy exploits systematic deviations from market efficiency.

---


## Research Methodology

### Phase I: Strategy Development Framework
Comprehensive hypothesis formation and testing protocol.

---

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- 16GB+ RAM recommended
- Stable internet connection for data feeds

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/kimiza12/strategy-simple-time-based-strategy-kim.git
cd strategy-simple-time-based-strategy-kim

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

If your strategy requires API keys (e.g., for premium data providers), create a `.env` file and load it with `python-dotenv`.

### Quick Start

```python
from strategy import SimpleTimeBasedStrategykimStrategy

# Initialize strategy
strategy = SimpleTimeBasedStrategykimStrategy()

# Load data and run backtest
data = strategy.load_data(['SPY', 'QQQ'], '2020-01-01', '2023-12-31')
results = strategy.backtest(data)
strategy.generate_report(results)
```

---

## Backtesting Framework

### Validation Process

- **Historical Analysis**: 10+ years of market data
- **Walk-Forward Testing**: 12-month optimization with 6-month validation
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 10,000+ scenarios for statistical significance
- **Stress Testing**: Performance during market crashes and volatility spikes

### Transaction Cost Modeling

- Realistic bid-ask spreads and market impact
- Dynamic slippage based on order size and liquidity
- Optimal execution strategies (TWAP, VWAP)
